* Anne Russett is the presenter, Kirk also presents
* This is the first of many presentation of many
* Overview
  * How we got to this point
  * Planning Process
  * Proposed Amendments
  * Types of Neighborhoods
  * Kirk
  * Summary of draft code
  * Discuss Next Steps

* Background
  * Initiated in January 2019 - with Opticos Design out of Berklee
    California
  * Tony Perez and Martin Gelendez(?) and kirk have put in a lot of work
    on the plan.
  * Want to create neighboorhoods that are safe for pedestrians,
    walking, preserve environment.  
  * Variety of Housing types and price points
  * Expect this code to expand to other areas over time
  * Whetherby Park is the Northern Boundary

## Planning Process

* Started in 2015 with the adoption of South District Plan.
* Project Direction Report
  * Worked with Opticos to assess the feasibility of the putting the
    code in place
  * Community need for small neighbood centers
  * Missing Middle Housing
    * Duplex --> Multiplex
  * Better Street Connectivity
  * Traffic calming
  * Need for environment aging in place
 * Was there a market for missing middle housing?
  * Study concluded there was
  * 2019 an initial draft of the code was released
  * 2021 - was spend revising the draft code to work within existing
    city processes. Just released a few weeks ago.
  * Met with community members, affordable housing advocates, HBAs

## Summary of Propsed Amendments

* Staff feels form based code aligns with existing south district plan
  * Amendments to more specificly link the code with the plan
  * Amendment #1: Future land use map - new land use descriptions and map
    * Allow missing middle and land use designations.
    * Options for neighboor hood centers (could be commercial)
  * A mix of building types
    * If 8 lots, not all can be of one type.  If 7 are single-family, 1
      cannot be.
    * Ensure diversity in the streetscape
    * Parking must be revised to allow closer to the front facade than
      currently
    * Required amount of parking has been reduced
    * Street trees are required
    * Block length will be reduced
    * Civic space types are defined and locations identified in the
      comprehansive plan.
    * Affordable Housing regulatory incentives
    * New Term: Design sites
      * Included to allow some flexibility -- can be administratively
        changed
      * Min and max depth and with standard to ensure more compact
        development

* Housing types dont show many garaged.
  * Incorporate a small main street area
* Current zongin code is limited in flexibility
* Zoning regulations have historically been used to segregate
  communities
* Conventional zongin results in auto-oriented development pattern
* City current zoning - 81% single-family.  Create a more equitable
  community
* Requires a mix of building types
* Incentives for affordable housing
* Creates neighboorhood nodes
* Ensures more compact development

## Nuts and Bolts of the code

Go to : form based zones and standards on the web
icgov.org/projects/form-based-zones-and-standards

* Intro

* To adopt standards that reflect the comprehansive plan to ensure that
  development reinforces Iowa City's character with a mix of uses in a
compact, walkable, transit-friendly environment
* The code is organized differently
  * Current, based on use - single-family, commercial, etc.
  * New: Organized around transect concept T1= most rural to T6 = most
    urban
* South Distrct generally T3 and T4 (urban) transects
  * 2 - 4 stories
* Process
  * Fits into the existing processes.  Not creating new ways, but rather
    enhance existing processing
  * Rezonining to form-based zone.
  * Recommend its is done concurrently with preliminary plat

Reviews must meet criteria

  * Complies with future land use map, except
    * Sensitive areas are present
    * Circumstances have changed / information has come to light such
      that is is in the public interest.
  * responds approporiately to the various site conditions
  * Transition occur within the block or across alleys
  * design of site suits unique topographical, environemnt, site layout,
    and constraints.

Subdivision process 

A more detailed preliminary plat

* Changes pushed to subdivision code instead of the zoning code.
* Administritative adjustments -- can change building size, frontage....
* The red lines are alleys...

A beefed up or more modified version of the regular development process

### Zones

### Civic Space Type Standards

A new concept for the City of Iowa City.

A civic space can be a public or private open space dedicated for public
use. 

#### Required open space

* Land must be provided for public open space, or a fee in-leiu be paid

#### Public Access and Visibility

* Public access ans visibility is required
* Access is ensured by single-loaded streets, bike / pedestrian paths/
* Building facades must "front" onto the civic space

#### Civic Space

* Designated as gathering space
* Commercial uses may be allowed
* should contribute to stormwater management

#### Greenway and the Green

Strolling, sidewalks, could be flanked by street, buildings.  Connector
to open space area.  Allowed in all zones except for T4 - Main Street
zone.

#### Plaza and Pocket Park / Plaza

Pocket plaza all zones. Plaza in T4 - Main Street only

#### Playground and Community Garden

Allowed in all zones and could be in any civic space. Community gardens
intended as garden plots for nearby residents.

#### Passage

A civic space and a thoroughfare. Available in all zones.  Houses are
expected to front it.  The pedestrian mall is an example of an urban
passage.

### Differences

* Classifies the open space
* Passage and thoroughfare types are formalized
* Built into the future land use map

* Public comments should be had by August 5th. Must be written comments.
  Formal public hearing is August 19th.

Susan Craig Questions:

* Question 1: parking - it seems like there are not nearly enough
  parking spaces.  Where is it? Electrical charging standards???
* Question 2: Still am fuzzy about the design sites and what that means.
  Anne's picture of the big squre divided into three was
confusing.
* Question 3: Gathering places may not be enough. This feels like a very
  dense development.
  * Future land use private vs public land use.

Mark Signs Questions:

* Affordable housing and fee in-lieu concept.  He's done with the fee
in-lieu.  Developers don't build affordable using.
* Other transportation issues - transporation is cutting bus routes.
* Concerned about the map.  Very distinct zones in very distinct
locations.
* Wants to hear more about what happens as thing change.
* Does this tie in needs to adjustment for rental codes?

Maria Padron Comments:

* agree with susan about electric vehicle stations
* really likes the reduction in parking requirements.  How to encourage
  man power transportation
* parking for bicycles? Wider streets?
* Regarding trees? Requiring use of native species to reduce water
  usage?  Use of local materials?
* Greenspaces - seem like there are not enough
* Greenway is allowed in some of the zones, but is not a requirement.
  What if a developer chooses not to have a greenspace?
* Stormwater management? Permeable pavement???
* The main concern is that some are suggestions. What happens if nobody
  chooses to do this?
* Also worried about the commercial spaces inside of the neighborhood.
