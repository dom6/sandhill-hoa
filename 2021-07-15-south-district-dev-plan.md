## Draft Code

From last meeting:

1. Intent and Principles
2. Zones
3. Use Standards
4. Site Standards
5. Civic Space Types

### Zones

Organized by Transect. Briefly went over T3 and T4 with very little info

### Building Type Standards 14-2H-6

* Scale
  * Based on intended character of zone
  * House-scale vs Block scale
    * Smaller buildings - house scale; block scale - covers most of the
      block
  * Intended to generate pedestrian-oriented buildings and streetscapes
* Building Type and Design Sites
  * One building per design site, certain my have multiple buildings.
    Carriage house may also be build where allowed
  * A range of sizes on a given which a given building type is allowed
  * A parcel can have multiple design sites
* Frontages
  * Each building type needs at least one frontage
  * primary entriance - must be along street or civic space
* Diversity
  * At least 2 different types per block

Carriage House
  * Allowed in all zones. Only 2 stories with a max width of 32 feet

House Large and House Small

  * Single family detached use
  * Large T3 neighborhood edge. 2.5 stories tall.  Max width 95'
  * House Small - T3NG. 2.5 stories. Max width 75'

Duplex Side-by-side and Stacked

  * side-by-side - the normal kind.  2 units within a design site.
    About the same size as a house large / single family home.  Narrower
than a house large.
  * Denser type of duplex.

Cottage Court

  * Not currently allowed by our code.  A courtyard with buildings
    around the outsize of it. No private individual rear yards.
  * 1.5 stories max
  * T3NE, T3NG, T4NS
  * Main entrance is on the court

Multiplex Small and Large

  * Small - T3NG, T4NS - approx size of large house
    * 2.5 stories about 90' wide.
  * Large - T4NM
    * 3.5 stories max with 100' wide

Townhouse

  * Variable based on zone.  Height and width are variable with more
    units, heights, and widths.  See picture.
  * T3ND - 2-3 Units, 1 site, 2.5 stories, 90'
  * T4MS - 4-8 units, 3 stacked, 3.5 stories, 200'

Courtyard Building Small and Large

  * Central court that replaces rear yard open space
  * small - 10-16 dwellings - T4NS and T4NM - 2.5 or 3.5 respectively. 100'
  * large - T4MS - 18-24 dwellings - 3.5 stories, 100'

Main Street Building

  * Unrestricted dwelling units.  Will likely have commercial. T4MS.
    Vertical mix of uses.  Ground commercial, residential above.

Transects

* T3 - Neighborhood.
* T4 - major intersections
  * Courtyards, townhomes, cottage courts
* T4NM - 3.5 stories
* T4MS - corner of McCollister and Sycamore

Differences

  * Building type from use
  * Simlar to Riverfont Crossings
  * Create new standards min / max bulk requirements
    * Requires housing diversity on each block
  * Current regulates by density of block sizes. New would be regulated
    by number or units.
  * Admnistrative change is a possibility.  A design type could switch
    out a single family for another qualifying design type.

Overview

  * Windows / Doors are called glazing. 30% minimum glazing.

## Architectural Elements

Tripartite Facade Articulation

  * Ground - must be have awnings / canopies, etc.
  * Middle - only required if 3 stories

Architectural Recessions

  * Applies to buildings of at least 2 stories
  * If it's a multifamily that is the size of a single family / duplex it does
    not have to apply.

Corner Element

  * Voluntary architectural Element. For a main street building
  * Can exceed max height limit

Rooftop Room

  * Voluntary - houses, duplexes, small courtyard buildings

Differences

  * Limited compared to other zone site specific standards.  And
    different from Riverfront Crossing.
  * This does not regulate building materials like the current code
    does.
  * We are not regulating window and architectual standards
    * We don't want to limit the architectural creativity in new
      neighborhoods.
  * Roof design is not included

Michael Hensch question

  * How is downtown different than a T4MS. Kirk if we had rezoned this
    with our current standards there wouldn't have been any material
standards that would have applied

## Frontage Types

Standards

  * Don't correspond to the uses. 
  * Buildings may have multiple frontages.  Have to have at least 1.
  * Individual entrances for ground floor units must access the streets
  * Require at least 2 different frontage types on each block T4MS is
    exempted from this requirement
  * Some standards may be adjusted for side street facades.
  * Want to look at the interaction between public right of way and the
    private yard.  This is the frontage type.

Porches

  * Related to specific standards, though common words
  * Can project into the front yard
  * A covered structure, can be elevated or at grade.  Must be open on 3
    sides.
  * Minimum 6 - 8 feet
  * All zones except for T4MS.
  * Engaged porch - partially set back within the facade.
    * The front and maybe one side may be open.

Dooryard and Stoop

  * Allowed in all zones.
  * Main wall is set back. Purpose to create an outdoor room.
  * 10' deep and 15' wide
  * The stoop - is to create separation.  It's set up a little higher to
    prevent people from looking directly in your window.
    * has a shallower depth than the dooryard

Forecourt

  * In denser zones. T4NM, T4MS. Similar to a court.
  * Susan - can anyone go there? Is this like a restaurant that would go
    there?  Kirk - it's a private area, but is intended to feel like
it's a public area.

Maker Shopfront and Shopfront

  * Intended for commercial buildings, but not restricted to commercial
    buildings. T4MS.
  * A restaurant or something could have roll down doors.  50% has to be
    glazed ( windows )
  * Shopfront - more substantial glazing. Intended for service, retail,
    restaurants, etc.
  * Susan - why glazing? Look at Kum and Go? You have the window, and
    just a wall behind it?  Why?  Kirk - that was because of the
standards. The intention is to open it into customer centric spaces.

Terrace

  * Elevated space between sidewalk and a commercial area.  This can be
    used in a residential area.  T4NM, T4MS.

Gallery and Arcade

  * Covered spaces.  T4MS.  The main facade if the building is setback
    from the front design site line and at grade.

Differences

  * Some similar requires in Riverfront Crossing. Required for each
    design site with the facade zone
  * Regulates the size and appearance. Guides transitions.
  * Reviewed during building permit, etc.

### Thoroughfare Type Standards

Build around the character of the zone. Mulit-modal thoroughfares -
incorporate different modes of transportation. Interconnected network
with multiple routes.

  * standards may be adjusted during the subdivision process.  Must meet
  specific criteria.
  * Street trees are required - can be delayed

Mike - will this become the responsibility of the lot owner / developer?
Kirk: Yes. Developer must pay an escrow to cover the cost of
installation. IF the developer fails to install, the city could then
install with the money.

Main Street

  * With and without a median. T4MS
  * Basically, McCollister along the main street.
  * Without median would be along sycamore.
  * 20' sidewalks minimum
    * It's wider than almost any one.
    * Maria Pardon - which sidewalk is 20'.  Trying to visualize? Kirk:
      Can't name off hand, but probably similar to Washington St. Anne:
  Washington street in front of US Bank is a 20' sidewalk.  In front of
  the Java House the sidewalk is 35'.
  * Bike Lanes - are showen corresponding to where the cities future bike
    lanes are planned.  Based on the bicycle master plan.

Avenues 2

  * McCollister - w/o parking and where parking will be placed.
  * Continuous planters instead of individual planters in this area.
  * Could be applied elsehwere

Avenues 3 / 4

  * Sycamore 3
  * South Gilbert 4
  * Planters wider than the McCollister area.

Neighborhood Streets 1 / 2

  * This is concerning with the reduced parking standards.  Intended to
    slow traffic on the streets.
  * Pretty much what we have for our current standards. ROW is a little
    wider.
  * Mike - what is the width in the current 60' standard.  Kirk: It's
    the same.

Alley

  * Allowed in all zones.  Must be behind the buildings. Fully paved
    with 20' travel lane.
  * Required along McCollister and S. Gilbert (unless vehicular access
    can be otherwise provided.) Allows modified site dimensions.  We
want to encourage designs behind buildings, to put garages in the back.
  * Mike - are these public or private? Kirk: Not defined, anticipate
    private

Passage

  * allowed in all zones
  * Must be paved, no sidewalks.
  * To allow pedestrian connections in exchange for longer block
    lengths.
  * Susan: the pedestrian street is the responsibility of the
    association / property owners.  Kirk: this does not have to be
public or private. Susan: The city does not maintain it? Kirk: It would
be the adjacent property owner. Anne: As passaged get full they would
likely be privately maintained. There may be a public access easement
through the subdivision process - allowing anyone to use the passage.

Susan: Could a gas station / conveniance store be built in here? Kirk:
We'll have to get back to you.

Differences

  * Mostly publically owned land.
  * Ensure multi-modal access is available
  * The frontage line in the slide is a hold-over

### Affordable Houseing Incentives

This has been added on since we have the initial public review.  Similar
to Riverfront Crossing.

Any additional unit has to be affordable. If you had 4 units you could
provide 5, but would be subject to the rest of the standards. Parking
reduction, developer would be required to include.

Hoping to encourage mixed income developments. Hope to increase the
number of units produced? Billie Townsend: Is there a time limit and
enforcement?

One adjustment to zone and one adjustment to building codes are allowed.
Zone standards can be adjusted. Additional adjustments may be available
based on who they're provided for.

* Income and Sales Limits
* Rent Limits
  * LIHTC - based on the income of the resident of the rental unit.
    These are higher rent limits - governed by the Iowa Finance
Authority
  * Maria Padron: Are you saying the income limits being shown, the 60%
    AMI for a family of 4  would be $60,000?  The fair market rent that
its affordable? Kirk: a household spending >30% of their income on
housing would be considered not affordable. <30% is considered
affordable.
  * Maria: Can 60% be modified by us? Kirk: HUD has a definition of low
    and moderate income. For rental households the standard uses 60%. As
far as changes we should discuss this later.
  * Sarah Hektoen - where the discresion comes in is whether P&Z and
    City Council wants to provide additional incentives for LIHTC
projects. What is proposed here is to provide additional incentives.
  * Billie Townsend - this is not affordable housing....
  * Mark Signs - I agree, this is affordable, but we cannot do anything
    about it. $1,500 is not affordable to anyone for a 1 bedroom
apartment.
  * Sarah - there are two programs we're talking about.  LIHTC is a
    separate animal.  We also have our own program.  We're offering
incentives for both projects.
  * Mike - we should encourage more LIHTC projects.  Not much is being
    built at all and we need to encourage these projects.
  * Mark - the limits are not too far off of the market rates.  The
    developer is the one benefiting from this. If we say this is
affordable, we're kidding ourselves.
  * Susan, 80% means they're making $80,000. It does go down as the
    income goes down
  * Mike - the definition of affordable is less than 30% of their
    income. The AMI in Iowa City is the highest in the state. Maybe we
can have examples of this in a future presentation.
  * Mark - I would say no incentives for LIHTC projects....That will
    make people mad, but that is what I think
  * Kirk - these percentages are based on your income.
  * Mike - was the Delray project LIHTC?
  * Maria - The problem is not a lack of affordable housing, we have a
    lot, they are not being occupied because we need more vouchers.  If
the city could create their own voucher program we could get people into
those properties.
  * Kirk - can we table this for now?

Requirements: Owner & Rental

  * Want to prevent something where the developer says a property is
    affordable, but the rooms, etc. are half the size, etc.

### Other Title 14 Changes (Zoning)

Sign Regulations

  * Dependent upon the intensity of the zone.  It allows different
  intensities of signage

General Definitions

  * We currently do not have half stories

### Title 15 Changes (Land Subdivision)

  * Plats and Platting Procedures
    * Most standards will be implemented in the preliminary plat. Will
      need to have notations about adjacent properties.
    * Neighboorhood plan is a new document that must be submitted with
      the final plat.
  * Susan: This will only apply to this particular area of the city,
    correct? Kirk: Yes.
  * Design standards - streets and circulation
  * The standards in the sub-division code is where the city can enforce
    compliance / standards. Changes should lead to a similar outcome.
  * Design Standards - Block and Lots
    * Want to avoid super blocks with no street connectivity

### Comprehensive Plan Draft Changes

  * Specifically located in the South District Plan.
  * Updates and Context
  * Goals and Objectives link goals of the form based code with the
    South District.
  * Information on how to contact staff is on the website

Billie: THese new codes, are they planning to replace all of the codes
eventually if they work on the South side? Kirk: Anne??? Anne: Right
now, we're just looking at the 900 acres.  We'd like to apply this code
to other greenfield areas.  Some are still in unincorporated Johnson
County that will eventually be annexed.
Billie: We'll have 2 standards then.
Anne: We'll actually have 4.

Mark: Form vs Use?  I still need to wrap my head around it.  Please
present something that helps us understand it. If I build a house, I
could put a business in it as I understand it.
